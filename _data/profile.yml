    Shreyas Deshmukh
I am a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore in the field of decision science, under the mentorship of Dr. Saudeep Deb. Here, I have worked on developing novel methodologies for predicting disease outbreaks and evaluating them using experimental and simulation approaches. Currently, I am focused on quantile autoregression and its efficiency in predicting higher values in time series data.

I am a dedicated researcher with a post-graduate degree in Statistics and a Master’s in Population Studies. With a profound interest in public health research. With a master’s in population studies from the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, my academic journey has been enriched with a comprehensive MSc in Statistics from Sardar Patel University, Anand, Gujarat, and a BSc in Statistics from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra.
